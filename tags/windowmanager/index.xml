However, the X11 windowing system is quite dated, having originated about 40 years ago. Its number of limitations, among other things, has led to the creation of the Wayland protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a modern protocol that allows compositors to operate in a more efficient and lightweight manner. Since its inception in 2008, it has gained popularity to the point where prominent display managers such as GNOME and KDE have adopted it &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://mutter.gnome.org/"&gt;Mutter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin"&gt;KWin&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>XMonad + Polybar on NixOS</title><link>https://gvolpe.com/blog/xmonad-polybar-nixos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 18:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gvolpe.com/blog/xmonad-polybar-nixos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a &lt;a href="https://www.gnome.org/"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; user for a long time and I have never cared about using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager"&gt;Window Manager&lt;/a&gt; ever before but I recently switched to using &lt;a href="https://xmonad.org/"&gt;XMonad&lt;/a&gt; full-time. Why? For a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try a lightweight window manager for a while. However, the main reason is that Gnome &lt;em&gt;leaks memory&lt;/em&gt;, unfortunately, and it seems to be an issue that&amp;rsquo;s been around &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnome-shell/+bug/1672297"&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;. Although it has been announced as allegedly solved, I have been experiencing a similar issue in Gnome 3.36 on &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/"&gt;NixOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

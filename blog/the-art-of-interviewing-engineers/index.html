Software Engineers, especially in the functional programming space, are a scarce resource. So the better the interview process, the bigger the chances you have of hiring great engineers.</p><p>During my career, I&rsquo;ve been part of the hiring process from day one, and I have learned a few lessons I would like to share with you all, given my recent frustration with some companies.</p><h2 id=1-two-or-more-engineers>1. Two or more engineers</h2><p>Most interviewing processes have a pair-programming session, which is probably the most delicate part. You will not only assess a candidate&rsquo;s coding skills but also their ability to work in a team.</p><p>It was at this stage where I&rsquo;ve seen many companies fail. They commit the <strong>most terrible mistake</strong>: having a single engineer on the company&rsquo;s side.</p><p>This is sort of a monarchy where you, the candidate, are judged by an individual who might not be as competent as two or more persons in doing so.</p><p>I cannot enumerate the number of times I have disagreed with my colleagues while interviewing a candidate. We all have different points of view, so having at least one more brain in the room will open up the chance for debate and avoid ending up with a biased decision.</p><p>Having two or more engineers applies to conducting any other interview, such as system design, code review, or behavioral assessment.</p><h2 id=2-give-feedback>2. Give feedback</h2><p>The sooner you get back to your candidate with feedback, the better. Whether you decide to move forward or not.</p><p>I would argue it is even more important to give feedback when you don&rsquo;t want to proceed with the candidate. Let them know about the reasons why you think they will not be considered for the current position.</p><p>It is a professional courtesy that will make your company respectable.</p><h2 id=3-ask-for-feedback>3. Ask for feedback</h2><p>Giving feedback shows professionalism; asking for feedback shows humility.</p><p>Your interview process might be <em>utterly broken</em> and far from perfect. So take this chance to get an outsider&rsquo;s opinion to improve it.</p><p>A good convo is to ask for feedback in the same email where you are giving it.</p><style>.quote::before{content:"📜"}</style><div class=quote><h4>Example</h4><p>Dear candidate,<br><br>We have decided not to move forward given the following reasons:<br><br>- first point</br>- second point</br>- etc</br><br>If you have some time, we kindly request your feedback about our hiring process. What did you think about it?<br>Kind regards,
The interviewer.</p></div><p>Being humble is one underrated skill.</p><h2 id=4-coding-challenge>4. Coding challenge</h2><p>If, as part of the process, you decide to go with a take-home coding challenge, be flexible when it comes to third-party libraries usage or different approaches.</p><p>Remember that you are asking engineers to free some of their time to get an <em>unpaid task</em> done. So at least let them choose the tech stack.</p><p>Most engineers take this task as a chance to explore some libraries they love or would love to use. Other engineers wouldn&rsquo;t even bother going through all of this, so be considerable.</p><p>What is more important is to evaluate their thinking-and-solving-problems ability. As long as they can defend their solution in the code review stage, the techniques or third-party libraries they might use will remain secondary. Defending a solution is something we, engineers, need to do quite often. So you will be assessing another critical engineering skill.</p><p>In the meantime, you — <em>the interviewer</em> — might learn a few things as well; it is a back-and-forth learning process.</p><h2 id=5-cut-the-bullshit>5. Cut the bullshit</h2><p>Let the formalities be handled by those who enjoy living in a world of bureaucracy.</p><p>If you know you have the chance to hire a great engineer, cut the bullshit and offer an alternative and quicker hiring process. Engineers hate beadledom.</p><p>If you succeed, you will more likely secure a bunch of great engineers who would be happy to work in a relaxed environment, free of that they spite the most.</p><p>Additionally, the happiness of your employees comes with other benefits; they will promote your company and recommend it to other engineers. It is a win-win strategy.</p><p>Ultimately, be clear about what you are looking for, but also be honest about the current situation of the company. Nobody wants to jump on a sinking ship. Don&rsquo;t oversell it.</p><h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><p>This is my top five. However, I believe a great hiring process should always be in constant improvement. Question your techniques and results at all times, and aim for a top-notch hiring process.</p><p>How about you, Software Engineer? What other pain points have you stumbled upon while taking interviews?</p><p>At last, I&rsquo;ll leave you with another great resource on <a href=http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowtoconductagoodProgrammingInterview.html>how to conduct a good programming interview</a>.</p></div><nav class=post-navigation><div class=nav-previous><span class=nav-label>← Previous</span>

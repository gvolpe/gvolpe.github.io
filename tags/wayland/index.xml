However, the X11 windowing system is quite dated, having originated about 40 years ago. Its number of limitations, among other things, has led to the creation of the Wayland protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a modern protocol that allows compositors to operate in a more efficient and lightweight manner. Since its inception in 2008, it has gained popularity to the point where prominent display managers such as GNOME and KDE have adopted it &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="https://mutter.gnome.org/"&gt;Mutter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin"&gt;KWin&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

However, the X11 windowing system is quite dated, having originated about 40 years ago. Its number of limitations, among other things, has led to the creation of the Wayland protocol.</p><p>This is a modern protocol that allows compositors to operate in a more efficient and lightweight manner. Since its inception in 2008, it has gained popularity to the point where prominent display managers such as GNOME and KDE have adopted it &mdash; <a href=https://mutter.gnome.org/>Mutter</a> and <a href=https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin>KWin</a>, respectively.</p><p>When it comes to modern tiling window managers, <a href=https://swaywm.org/>Sway</a> has led the way by implementing the Wayland protocol, while taking inspiration from <a href=https://i3wm.org/>i3</a> for X11.</p><p>Personally, it wasn&rsquo;t until <a href=https://hypr.land/>Hyprland</a> came around that I felt adventurous enough to consider Wayland a serious time investment. While I didn&rsquo;t specifically write about it in this blog, you can see it mentioned in a <a href=../home-manager-dotfiles-management>recent blogpost</a>. I had a good ride with it, but ultimately, I wasn&rsquo;t entirely satisfied with the overall experience.</p><p>So it was only a matter of time until the inevitable happened&mldr; I had a very interesting project on my radar for a while, and finally the universes aligned to allow me the time to give it a try &mdash; and holy cows, there&rsquo;s no way back.</p><h2 id=a-new-tiling-wayland-compositor>A new tiling Wayland compositor</h2><p><img src=../../images/niri/niri-logo.svg alt=logo></p><p><a href=https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri>Niri</a> is written in Rust, and it is simply described as a &ldquo;scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor&rdquo; which is heavily inspired by <a href=httpspaperwm/PaperWM>PaperWM</a>. By default, windows are spawned next to each other on an infinite horizontal space! 🤯</p><p>While it may not sound very appealing, I can tell you from experience that it&rsquo;s liberating. It would be counter-productive, however, if we limited ourselves to a single scrollable horizontal tile. The good news is that Niri also supports workspaces, and multiple monitors are first-class citizens.</p><p><img src=../../images/niri/workspace.png alt=workspace></p><p>Moreover, <a href=https://yalter.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html>screencasting</a> is supported via <a href=https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/xdg-desktop-portal-gnome>xdg-desktop-portal-gnome</a>, which makes sense, given the author is a GNOME contributor.</p><p>And there are a lot of other features such as layers, tabs, gestures, and the ever important <a href=https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html>XWayland</a> support via <a href=https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite>xwayland-satellite</a>.</p><h3 id=scratchpads>Scratchpads</h3><p>Scratchpads are a crucial feature of any tiling window manager for my workflows. I mainly use it for Spotify and a File Manager, but it&rsquo;s good to know we have the option of starting any application as a scratchpad.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not a native Niri feature. However, it recently gained support for <a href=https://yalter.github.io/niri/Floating-Windows.html>floating windows</a>, which combined with <a href=https://yalter.github.io/niri/IPC.html>IPC socket communication</a> with the running Niri instance, gives us what we need to build scratchpad support.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve done: <a href=https://github.com/gvolpe/niri-scratchpad>gvolpe/niri-scratchpad</a>. All we need is a rather simple script, so users are encouraged to play around with it and customize it.</p><h2 id=showcase>Showcase</h2><p>Writing more about it would be boring. Let me show you what it feels like to use it!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading=lazy referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="../../images/niri/showcase.mp4?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="Local video"></iframe></div><p>It is also possible to view it on <a href=https://youtu.be/Mo4nO6mI9DU>YouTube</a> if that&rsquo;s preferred.</p><p>These are only some of the features that Niri offers, but there&rsquo;s so much more I didn&rsquo;t cover in this video such as resizing windows, moving windows between workspaces, etc. The overview is perhaps my favorite of them all!</p><p>You can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeYx2exm04M">this excellent review video</a> by Brodie Robertson.</p><h2 id=closing-remarks>Closing remarks</h2><p>It&rsquo;s only been two weeks using Niri and I&rsquo;m extremely happy with it. It feels fast, snappy and beautiful. I love it when a tiling window manager is lightweight and efficient, enabling the user to become one with it &mdash; increasing productivity.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all I have. If you like the project, go give it a star. You can also sponsor its main developer <a href=https://github.com/sponsors/YaLTeR>Ivan Molodetskikh</a>, he would definitely appreciate it.</p><p>Best,
Gabriel.</p></div><div id=gh-comments><div id=gh-comments-list></div></div><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js integrity="sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://gvolpe.com/js/github-comments.js></script><script type=text/javascript>DoGithubComments("gvolpe/blog-comments","34")</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view comments.</noscript><div class=related-posts><h3>Related Content</h3><div class=related-grid><div class=related-post><h4><a href=https://gvolpe.com/blog/xmonad-polybar-nixos/>XMonad + Polybar on NixOS</a></h4><div class=related-meta>2020.11.25 •

&lt;p&gt;Join Gabriel to learn how to deal with side effects in a pure functional way while abstracting over the effect type to take composition to the next level. Starting with a review of the basic concepts, you will explore the most important features, such as synchronous and asynchronous computations, error handling, safe resource management, concurrency, parallelism and cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

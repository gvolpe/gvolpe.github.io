Since the first introduction of Cats Effect, many things have changed and this has taken its design and performance to a whole new level.

Join Gabriel to learn how to deal with side effects in a pure functional way while abstracting over the effect type to take composition to the next level. Starting with a review of the basic concepts, you will explore the most important features, such as synchronous and asynchronous computations, error handling, safe resource management, concurrency, parallelism and cancellation.

In addition, Gabriel will demonstrate how these abstractions make complex problems trivial in their current production systems.
